                        <p>Co-founded with Dr. Ana Paula Centeno, the Assignment Guru Program aims to create assignments for CS111 and CS112 that demonstrate the positive social impact of computing. The program integrates social responsibility and visual applications into early computing courses, making assignments more engaging and relatable for students. Supported by the Advancing Women in Computer Science initiative, the program fosters collaboration among peers, faculty, and mentors, contributing to a more inclusive CS environment at Rutgers.</p>

                        <p>Having been introduced to this game when I was 5, I really enjoyed the idea of driving a metal sarcophagus and shoot explosive pellets out of it! About 15 years later, sometimes, to this day, I find myself enjoying this game as I always did with my father. One day, an idea arose to me to create a trainer that focuses on every single tank in this game and shows which area is best to shoot this tank at, or the general weak spots of the tank and easily accessible information about them. This project is still work in progress, and is expected to take a long time to build</p>

                        <p>As one of my dear friends say, "Health is wealth," and there is no better time to focus on it than while I am in my early 20s. I consistently bulk and cut to increase my strength while maintaining a lean body, though cutting has proven to be difficult, therefore I am sticking to maintaining a lean body instead. I tend to work out 5 times a week, and resting the remaining two, as the body needs to rest as well, otherwise, I hinder my progress</p>

                        <p>A mind cannot be always working, sometimes you have to leisure it! Gaming is one of my all-time passions, having received my first ever computer at the age of 8, I surfed the Internet and found myself playing Flash games at first, and then I slowly migrated into platforms like Steam, Epic Games, and so forth. My main interests are FPS, though I sometimes need to lay off that and instead play indie games like Stardew Valley or singleplayer games like The Witcher 3</p>

                        <h3>Swimming</h3>
                        <p>One of my childhood passions, I used to swim since I was 6 years old, retiring professionally at the age of 18. I loved swimming dearly, with my favorite stroke being freestyle, followed by fly. My greatest accomplishment was becoming the 14th best swimmer in my category in 50m Freestyle during the Spanish Championships in 2019 with a time of 25.03s. My all-time best record in 50m LCM is 25.00s, yet to be beaten (or perhaps I'll keep it that way for aesthetics sake). It is a great sport that I still practice to this day, as I am currently appointed as the Meet Director for Rutgers Swim Club (and I am considering becoming their coach for my senior year...), but, time will tell!</p>
